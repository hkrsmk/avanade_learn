avanade learning

The mini projects I built to learn about Avanade stuff, via the guides.
ContosoPizza would be the most relevant for APIs and understanding the relevant parts.

I also fiddled around with submodules; so fun. /s
Decided to fork the submodules I was modifying, so that the original code was not modified.
