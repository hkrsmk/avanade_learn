avanade learning

The mini projects I built to learn about Avanade stuff, via the guides.
ContosoPizza would be the most relevant for APIs and understanding the relevant parts.

I also fiddled around with submodules; so fun. /s
Decided to fork the submodules I was modifying (`mslearn-improve-api-[...]`), so that the original code was not modified, and I can still save my changes as a submodule properly.
